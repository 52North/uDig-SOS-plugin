# 52°North uDig Sensor Observation Plugin (SOS)

uDig is a Desktop GIS written in Java and based on the eclipse platform.
It is a free and open source software project driven by Refractions
Research. This application adds the ability to the uDig system to access
sensor data served by Sensor Observation Services implementing version
1.0.0 of the OGC specification.

On the one hand this application allows access of the features of
interest observed by the sensors of an SOS. Those features can be
displayed in the map view by adding a new layer to uDig. On the other
hand it is possible to visualized the observation data served by the SOS
in a table view.
