

- Spatial Operators not used in requests. 
- Parameter BoundingBox is not used. This leads to some unnecessary requests. May be difficult to implement.
- Requests with TimeInstants or TimePeriods have a max. accuracy of seconds, this needs to be changed in SOS and OXF
- a lot of Strings are not externalized
- SOSCapabilities reads not all information from SOS like provider and contact information
